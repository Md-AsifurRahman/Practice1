            <p>
                Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to
                introduceyourselfbecause you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give
                a
                try
                to seewhatkind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about
                myself
                andyourimpression about me are not so different. Here it goes.I am a person who is positive about every
                aspectoflife

            <h3>To Become a......</h3>
            <p>
                There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like
                tothink,
                I
                like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, Ilike to see
                the
                moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell thewind coming from the
                ocean.
                I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to dothought experiment when I cannot
                sleep in
                the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain insummer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.
                I
                like
                to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to bealone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like
                country’s
                peace, I like metropolis’ noise;</p>
